Repository for my Python Projects
=================================
[Archery Game](https://github.com/Dagonite/python-projects/tree/main/Archery%20Game)
---
Simple graphical game where the user has to take the wind direction into account before shooting arrows at a target. The user then gets a grade depending on their score.

[FizzBuzz](https://github.com/Dagonite/python-projects/tree/main/FizzBuzz)
---
My solution to the FizzBuzz game.

[Graphical Traced Walk](https://github.com/Dagonite/python-projects/tree/main/Graphical%20Traced%20Walk)
---
Program that draws a two-dimensional grid with a person at the centre. Every quarter of a second, the person takes a random step up, down, left, or right. The program ends once the person leaves the grid. This is an adaption of my tracedwalk2d.py program from Pract09 of the Worksheets.

[Patchwork Sampler](https://github.com/Dagonite/python-projects/tree/main/Patchwork%20Sampler)
---
University coursework where I had to write a program that displays a patchwork sample which is unique to my university number. The size and colours of the patchwork are decided by the user. After the patchwork is drawn, the user may click a tile to cycle the available colours for it.

[Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/Dagonite/python-projects/tree/main/Sudoku%20Solver)
---
A program that solves any given Sudoku puzzle by using a backtracking algorithm and then prints out the solution.

[Worksheets](https://github.com/Dagonite/python-projects/tree/main/Worksheets)
---
Worksheets I completed that were given by my university. Each worksheet contains roughly a dozen problems which I have solved.
