Repository for my small Python projects
===
[Archery Game](https://github.com/Dagonite/python-projects/tree/main/Archery%20Game)
---
Simple game where the user has to take the wind direction into account before shooting arrows at a target. The user then gets a grade depending on their score. This game requires imports from my `python-exercises` repo.

[Blackjack](https://github.com/Dagonite/python-projects/tree/main/Blackjack)
---
A game of Blackjack between a user and a computer. This project makes use of object-oriented programming.

[Graphical Traced Walk](https://github.com/Dagonite/python-projects/tree/main/Graphical%20Traced%20Walk)
---
Program that draws a two-dimensional grid with a person at the centre. Every tenth of a second, the person takes a random step up, down, left, or right. Every square of the grid displays how many times the person has visited it. The walk ends once the person leaves the grid. Data from the traced walk is then appended to a CSV file. This data is then used to generate graphs. This is an adaption of my tracedwalk2d.py from Pract09 of the Worksheets found within my `python-exercises` repo.

[Guess the Number](https://github.com/Dagonite/python-projects/tree/main/Guess%20the%20Number)
---
Guess a randomly selected number within a certain amount of tries.

[Hangman](https://github.com/Dagonite/python-projects/tree/main/Hangman)
---
A game of Hangman. Select a difficulty then try to win as many rounds as possible without losing all of your lives.

[Noughts and Crosses](https://github.com/Dagonite/python-projects/tree/main/Noughts%20and%20Crosses)
---
A game of Noughts and Crosses. This makes use of a magic square to determine if there are three of the same symbol in a line.

[Patchwork Sampler](https://github.com/Dagonite/python-projects/tree/main/Patchwork%20Sampler)
---
University coursework where I had to write a program that displays a patchwork sample which is unique to my university number. The size and colours of the patchwork are decided by the user. After the patchwork is drawn, the user may click a tile to cycle the available colours for it.

[Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/Dagonite/python-projects/tree/main/Sudoku%20Solver)
---
A program that solves any given Sudoku puzzle by using a backtracking algorithm. Currently, working on a playable graphical user interface.

[Turtle Race](https://github.com/Dagonite/python-projects/tree/main/Turtle%20Race)
---
Watch turtles race it out.

Requirements
---
A few of these projects will require John Zelle's simple object-oriented graphics library [graphics.py](https://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics.py) to work. To install the library, enter the following into a command-line interpreter (will require pip to be installed as well):

```
pip install graphics.py
```

Alternatively, download it from the above link and place it somewhere Python can find it, e.g. `Lib/site-packages`.
