'''
4.
Write another random walk program graphicalwalks.py that graphically simulates
two dimensional random walks. Each walk should end when the walker is a specified
distance way from the start point. The program should begin by asking the user for
this distance and the number of walks to simulate. It should then draw a circle
in the centre of a graphics window showing the boundary of the walking area. The
route of each random walk should be traced out starting from the centre point. Use
a black line of length 5 for each step of the walk. (Hint: the step lines should
fill out the circle evenly â€“ if all the walks tend to head in one general direction
then you have made a mistake.)
